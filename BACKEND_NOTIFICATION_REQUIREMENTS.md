# Backend Requirements for New Thread Notifications

## Overview
The frontend now supports notifications for new thread creation. When a user creates a new event thread, all other logged-in users should receive a browser notification.

## Required Backend Changes

### 1. Socket.io Event Emission
When a new thread is successfully created, emit a socket event to all connected clients:

```javascript
// In your thread creation endpoint (e.g., POST /api/threads)
// After successfully creating the thread in the database:

io.emit('new-thread-created', {
  threadId: newThread.id,
  title: newThread.title,
  creator: newThread.creator,
  creatorId: newThread.creatorId
});
```

### 2. Example Implementation

```javascript
// Example in your backend route handler
app.post('/api/threads', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const threadData = {
      title: req.body.title,
      description: req.body.description,
      creator: req.body.creator,
      creatorId: req.body.creatorId,
      location: req.body.location,
      tags: req.body.tags,
      expiresAt: req.body.expiresAt,
      // ... other fields
    };

    // Create thread in database
    const newThread = await Thread.create(threadData);

    // Emit socket event to all connected clients
    io.emit('new-thread-created', {
      threadId: newThread.id,
      title: newThread.title,
      creator: newThread.creator,
      creatorId: newThread.creatorId
    });

    // Also keep existing 'refresh-threads' event for backward compatibility
    io.emit('refresh-threads');

    res.json({
      success: true,
      thread: newThread
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

## Frontend Implementation (Already Done)

### Features Implemented:
1. ‚úÖ Notification permission request after user registration
2. ‚úÖ Socket listener for 'new-thread-created' event
3. ‚úÖ Browser notification display when new threads are created
4. ‚úÖ Click handler on notification to focus window and refresh threads
5. ‚úÖ Filter to prevent users from seeing notifications for their own threads

### Notification Flow:
1. User registers ‚Üí Notification permission requested automatically (1 second delay)
2. Permission granted ‚Üí User receives welcome notification
3. Another user creates a thread ‚Üí Backend emits 'new-thread-created' event
4. Frontend receives event ‚Üí Shows browser notification (if enabled)
5. User clicks notification ‚Üí Window focuses and thread list refreshes

## Testing

### To Test Notifications:
1. Register a new account (notification permission will be requested)
2. Allow notifications when prompted
3. Open another browser/incognito window
4. Login with a different account
5. Create a new thread with the second account
6. First account should receive a notification: "üéâ New Event Thread! [Creator] created: [Title]"

## Notification Settings

Users can enable/disable notifications using the "Enable Alerts" button in the header.

## Browser Support
- Chrome/Edge: Full support ‚úÖ
- Firefox: Full support ‚úÖ
- Safari: Full support (with user gesture required) ‚úÖ
- Mobile browsers: Limited support ‚ö†Ô∏è
